HTTP Fan Out Server written in Go
====
HTTP fan-out server. What it does is very simple. It listens any incoming HTTP packets on registered uri (rule) and forwards what it gets to attached recipients (out).

This is quite useful if you need to listen for callbacks from external service if same one does not support notifying your application on multiple urls.


### Running behind NAT?

Well that's easy today :) You can always use [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)! It's free and can for sure can very efficiently tunnel out your local machine. As well written in [Go](https://golang.org/)
